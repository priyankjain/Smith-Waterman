Can you TODAY convert this Perl code to PHP?

http://etutorials.org/Misc/blast/Part+II+Theory/Chapter+3.+Sequence+Alignment/3.2+Local+Alignment+Smith-Waterman/

The PHP code should be a function that looks like this:

function smith_waterman ($str1, $str2, &$HTML)

where the function return is the SCORE, the strings are input sequences of letters (eg ABCDEFG & ABCEFG) and $HTML is the alignment which in this case is eg (a gap is introduced):

ABCDEFG
ABC-EFG
